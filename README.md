# friend_Finder

This is a full-stack application using React, Node, and MongoJS. In this app, users can find their "perfect match" by taking a short quiz. The program will either connect them with another user, or with a celebrity who is already pre-coded into the database. The app uses a node back-end and handlebars on the front end.
